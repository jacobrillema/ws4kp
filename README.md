# WeatherStar 4000+

A live version of this project is available at https://weatherstar.netbymatt.com

## About

This project aims to bring back the feel of the 90's with a weather forecast that has the look and feel of The Weather Channel at that time but available in a modern way. This is by no means intended to be a perfect emulation of the WeatherStar 4000, the hardware that produced those wonderful blue and orange graphics you saw during the local forecast on The Weather Channel. If you would like a much more accurate project please see the [WS4000 Simulator](http://www.taiganet.com/). Instead, this project intends to create a simple to use interface with minimal configuration fuss. Some changes have been made to the screens available because either more or less forecast information is available today than was in the 90's. Most of these changes are captured in sections below.

## Acknowledgements

This project is based on the work of [Mike Battaglia](https://github.com/vbguyny/ws4kp). It was forked from his work in August 2020.

* Mike Battaglia For the original project and all of the code which draws the weather displays. This code remains largely intact and was a huge amount of work to get exactly right.
* The team at [TWCClassics](https://twcclassics.com/) for several resources.
	* A [font](https://twcclassics.com/downloads.html) set used on the original WeatherStar 4000
	* [Icon](https://twcclassics.com/downloads.html) sets
	* Countless photos and videos of WeatherStar 4000 forecasts used as references.

## Why the fork?

The fork is a result of wanting a more manageable, modern code base to work with. Part of it is an exercise in my education in JavaScript. There are several technical changes that were made behind the scenes.

* Make use of the new API available at https://api.weather.gov ([documentation](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api)). This caused the removal of some of the original WeatherStar 4000 displays.
* Changed code to make extensive use of ES6 functionality including:
	* Arrow functions
	* Promises
	* Async/await and parallel loading of all forecast resources
	* Classes
* Common code base for each display through use of classes
* Separation between weather display code and user interface
* Use of a modern date parsing library [luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/)
* Attempt to remove the need for a local server to bypass [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) issues with the various APIs used. This is almost workable but there are still some minor CORS issues with https://api.weather.gov.

## What's different

I've made several changes to this Weather Star 4000 simulation compared to the original hardware unit and the code that this was forked from.

* Narration was removed. In the original code narration made use of the computer's local text-to-speech engine which didn't sound great.
* Music was removed. I don't want to deal with copyright issues and hosting MP3s. If you're looking for the music that played during forecasts please visit [TWCClassics](https://twcclassics.com/audio/).
* Marine forecast (tides) is not available as it is not part of the new API.
* The nearby cities displayed on screens such as "Latest Observations" and "Regional Forecast" are likely not the same as they were in the 90's. The weather monitoring equipment at these stations move over time for one reason or another, and coming up with a simple formulaic way of finding nearby stations is sufficient to give the same look-and-feel as the original.
* The "Local Forecast" and "Extended Forecast" provide several additional days of information compared to the original format in the 90's.
* "Flavors" are not present in this simulation. Flavors refer to the order of the weather information that was shown on the original units.

## Wish list

As time allows I will be working on the following enhancements.

* On/off selection of the displays that are used when in "play" mode.
* Better error reporting when api.weather.gov is down (happens more often than you would think)

And the following technical fixes.

* Caching of the animated gifs, specifically after they are decompressed
* Proper settings for static resource caching
* Build system integration to reduce the number of scripts that need to be loaded

## Issue reporting and feature requests

Please do not report issues with api.weather.gov being down. It's a new service and not considered fully operational yet. Before reporting an issue or requesting a feature please consider that this is not intended to be a perfect recreation of the WeatherStar 4000, it's a best effort that fits within what's available from the API and within a web browser.
